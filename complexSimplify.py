#QUESTION A
real = 1 #declaring the value for the real number

imag = complex(0, 3) #declaring the value for the imaginary number

exponent = complex(0, 2) #declaring the value for the exponent

answer = (real + imag) ** exponent #calculating the answer according to the equation given in the question

print( "Question 1a: (1+3i)²ⁱ = ", answer) #outputting answer
print()



#QUESTION B
real = 1 #declaring the value for the real number

imag = complex(0, math.sqrt(3)) #declaring the value for the imaginary number

exponent = 10 #declaring the value for the exponent

answer = (real + imag) ** exponent #calculating the answer according to the equation given in the question

print( "Question 1b: (1 + √3i)¹⁰ⁱ = ", answer) #outputting answer
